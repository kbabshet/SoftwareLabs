Capacity is the number of elements the vector is able to store (memory has been allocated). Size is the number of elements that have been added to the vector.
When size equals capacity, the capacity doubles which is why capacity is a power of 2.



At the moment the line number is only shown once (even if the word is repeated). No major changes to the design would have to be made, only small interface changes
